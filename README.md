## Install
You'll need to install the free **Bebas Neue** font. You can find download it [here](http://fontfabric.com/bebas-neue/) (or use this [direct link](http://fontfabric.com/downfont/bebas.zip)). Note that Bebas Neue has *its own license* independent of this theme. It's pretty liberal though.

After you've got that, just double-click on the theme file `Cool Story Bro.kth` and Keynote can take it from here.

#### License
MIT Licensed

That said..I really don't care what you do with this...but having a clear license makes it easy for lurkers to know for sure they're good to copy and use.
